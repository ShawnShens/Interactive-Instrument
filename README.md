# Interactive-Instrument
This guys is an interactive instrument utilising hand tracking and sound to make an interactive instrument

YO GUYS

So this is the github repository for the quality control of the code that will be further developed.
Google docs would have been a suitable idea for quality control but if major changes have been made
there would be a large volue of files that would be created.

So this is the alternative....it's okay if the setup is very complicated and the user controls are not as intuitive for 
end users but this is mostly used by developers and offers quality control functions.

but I myself don't know much about using this as well...but help yourself to the wide arrangement of documents and github 
forumns that will help you in working your way around the software.

Any major questions feel free to ask.
